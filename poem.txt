Our 3th Anniversary & our trips together.

My love,
my life, 
my reason behind,
and could't without,
Dani you are my life.

Your face, your hair, leaves any other behind. 

and when the moon is at my side,
I see your eyes, even tought I am miles far.

In this our 3th anniversary I want you to know,
my heart belongs to you, 
I want you safe and by my side.
